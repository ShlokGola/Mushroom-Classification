This repository contains some scripts that I made about exploring a dataset about mushroom and applying machine learning algorithm to create a classification model. everything was coded in R. I also made a web application using the RShinny plaltform which I will provide the link below. Hope you guys enjoy this simple web application, and please leave some feedback so I can figure out how to make my creation better and more effective.
