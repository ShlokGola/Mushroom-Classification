This repository is about building a model to help in the identification of poisonous mushrooms, based on the features of the mushrooms
themselves, may help people to stay safe and well. Everything is coded in R. Please leave some feedback so I can figure out how to make my creation better and more effective.

The dataset presents data on a variety of features representing the physical and environment characteristics of mushroom species.
